Don’t write a copy constructor if shallow copies are ok: In C++, If an object has no pointers or any run time allocation of resource like file handle, a network connection..etc, a shallow copy is probably sufficient. Therefore the default copy constructor, default assignment operator, and default destructor are ok and you don’t need to write your own.
