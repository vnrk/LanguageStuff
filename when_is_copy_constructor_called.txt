In c++, a copy constructor id called in the following cases :
	1. When an object of the class is returned by value.
	2. When an object of the class is passes (to a function) by value as an aargument.
	3. When an object is constructed based on another object of the same class.
	4. When compiler generates a temporary object.
	
It is however, not guaranteed that a copy constructor will be called in all these cases, because the C++ Standard allows the compiler to optimize the copy away in certain cases, one example being the return value optimization (sometimes referred to as RVO).
