cout << endl vs cout << "\n" in C++

Although they both seem to do the same thing, there is a subtle difference between them.

cout << endl  : Inserts a new line and flushes the stream

cout << "\n"  : Only inserts a new line.


Therefore,

cout << endl;

can be said equivalent to

cout << ‘\n’ << flush;

As a conclusion, cout << “\n” seems performance wise better than cout << endl; unless flushing of stream is required.
